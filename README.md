## Project Overview

This project includes practical implementations of blockchain technology. The practicals demonstrate how to create private and public blockchains using JavaScript, and handle concepts such as Proof of Work (PoW).

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 16.x or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Installation

1. **Create a new directory for the project**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a directory and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir blockchain-practical
   cd blockchain-practical
   ```

2. **Initialize the Node.js project**:
   Run the following command to create a `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This will create a basic `package.json` file.

3. **Install any required dependencies**:
   If your code requires additional Node.js packages, you can install them using npm. For example:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   *Note: Include any other dependencies your project requires in the `package.json` file.*

## Saving Code

1. **Create the necessary JavaScript files**:
   You need to create a JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) for your project.

2. **Copy the code**:
   Open the newly created `index.js` file in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code) and paste the blockchain code into the file.

## Running the Project

1. After saving the code, run the JavaScript file using Node.js by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Verify the Output**:
   Once the code is running, check the terminal for the output generated by the blockchain project. You should see logs or information about the blocks, transactions, or Proof of Work (PoW) results.
